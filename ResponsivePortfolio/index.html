                    <br> As one of my favorite quotes, it seemed appropriate while i fill you in on a few things about me.
                    <br> Programming started out as a required class for my degree and after a year and a half,
                    <br>it flourished into a part of my everyday life.
                    <br> Academics have always been a struggle for me because of my severe Dyslexia.
                    <br>Because I learn differently than the average person, I have always been drawn to creativity.
